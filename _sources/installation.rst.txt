Installation
============

Getting started
---------------
In order to get started you will need to download the latest distribution wheel.
A wheel is a built package that can be installed without needing to go through the `build` process.
Installing wheels is substantially faster for the end user than installing from a source distribution.

To install the package follow instructions below:

1. Open a commandline console via start menu > Start > cmd >
2. Navigate to download location of installation wheel::

    C:\users\[user]> cd C:\path\to\wheel

3. Run pip to install the wheel into you Python installation::

    C:\path\to\wheel> pip install boka_tools_py3_none_any.whl
    > boka_tools succesfully installed

Note that if you want to install using `pip`, you will need to have Python and pip registered to your
PATH variable. If you don't have `pip` registered to your path you will see the following error message::

    'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
    operable program or batch file.

To register `pip` to your PATH please follow these instructions: https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/
