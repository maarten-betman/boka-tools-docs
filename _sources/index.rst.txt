boka-tools documentation
======================================
Welcome to the boka-tools documentation.
This module contains python code that I made in the course of my placements on various
dredging projects. Here you will find the python code api and some working examples.

Main features of the module are:

- Parsing Primavera P6 files
- Plotting gantt charts
- Parsing AGS files
- Plotting CPT and BH data

More code will be added in future releases.

Feel free to contact me and please report any bugs found in the code!
